This is a PHP script for merging a new .dist file with your existing .conf file (trinitycore and trinityrealm)
It should also work with mangos dist/conf files as well.

It uses sessions so it is multi user safe, it adds any options that are removed to the bottom of the file,
commented out, just in case it removes something it shouldn't,
and, if you add all of your custom patch configs below "# Custom" they will be copied exactly as they are.
